Angry Meenky's Finite State Machine
===============

Easily build Finite State Machines (FSM) that don't require child nodes.
The FSM is entirely contained within a single node in your scene.
It is integrated with the Node inspector for adding/removing states, transitions, and callbacks.
The AMFiniteStateMachine class provides a simple mechanism to register callbacks, similar to connecting a signal, at build time or run time.
This allows for targeted signaling based on the states involved during trigger handling.
